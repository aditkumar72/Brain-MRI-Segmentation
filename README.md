# Identifying Brain Tumor from MRI images

# (I) Objective : The objective of this project is to identify brain tumor from MRI images using FastAI's Dynamic UNet with ResNet34 as Encoder.

# (II) Dataset Used :

This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
